This vignette covers theory and usage of the `solve` and `project` R functions in the `RcppML` package.

## Introduction and Installation

You may install the latest stable development version of RcppML from github:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("zdebruine/RcppML")
```

RcppML currently offers the fastest NNLS solvers in the R community. It is being actively extended to offer high-performance machine learning algorithms, such as exceptionally fast and robust matrix factorization, and sensitive clustering.

## Solving Systems of Equations

The `RcppML::solve` function solves the equation \eqn{ax = b} for \eqn{x} where \eqn{a} is symmetric positive definite matrix of dimensions \eqn{m x m} and \eqn{b} is a vector of length \eqn{m} or a matrix of dimensions \eqn{m x n}.

Unlike `base::solve`, `RcppML::solve` requires symmetric positive definite \eqn{a}. Complex numbers in \eqn{b} are also not supported, and \eqn{b} is required.

Why use `RcppML::solve`?

* Extremely fast Cholesky decomposition (using the Eigen C++ library)
* Refinement of solutions by gradient descent
* Fastest algorithm for Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS)
* Tractable methods for approximate and near-exact L0 regularization
* Support for convex L1, L2, and PE regularizations on \eqn{a} and/or \eqn{b}
* OpenMP parallelization across samples when \eqn{b} is a matrix
* Support for "float" (faster) and "double" (slower) precision

## Projecting Linear Models

* `RcppML::solve` masks `base::solve` to provide a faster solver for systems of equations using the Eigen cholesky module.
